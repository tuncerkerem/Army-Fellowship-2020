# Project for the CTO of the Assistant Secretary of the Army

In Summer 2020, I received a full-time fellowship from the National Security Innovation Network to assist the Chief Technology Officer of The Office of the United States Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology. Through extensive discussions with project supervisors, I developed a Python script that combined various capabilities, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, web scraping, and dashboard building. I achieve this goal with the help of numerous Python libraries, including selenium, spacy, pandas, deeppavlov, plotly, nltk, and textblob. The end product was a search engine, where the user could enter a technology term (e.g., UAV) and see the specific technologies that are being talked about in media & on social media and their respective sentiment & polarity scores in a digestible dashboard format.

In this repository, you can find the complete Python script for the project.
